### Description: Automated Report Generation

**Introduction**

Generating reports is a fundamental task in data analysis and business intelligence. Automating this task can save significant time and effort. This theory explains a practical approach to reading data from a file, analyzing it, and generating a formatted PDF report using Python libraries such as `pandas` for data handling and `FPDF` for creating the PDF output.

**Key Components of the Process**

1. **Reading Data from a File**
   
   In this process, the `pandas` library plays a vital role in reading and manipulating the data. The method `pd.read_csv("data.csv")` is used to load a CSV file into a DataFrame for analysis. CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are commonly used to store tabular data.
   
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
   ```

   Error handling is incorporated using a `try-except` block to catch situations where the file might not be found:

   ```python
   try:
       data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("The file 'data.csv' was not found.")
       exit()
   ```

2. **Data Analysis**
   
   Once the data is loaded, the `describe()` method is used to generate a statistical summary, including metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for numerical columns:
   
   ```python
   report_content = "Data Summary:\n" + str(data.describe())
   ```

3. **PDF Report Generation**

   The `FPDF` library is used to create a structured and formatted PDF report. A custom class `PDFReport` is defined, extending the `FPDF` class. Key methods include:

   - `header()`: Adds a title at the top of each page.
   - `footer()`: Displays the page number at the bottom.
   - `chapter_title()`: Prints section titles.
   - `chapter_content()`: Writes the content of each section.

   ```python
   pdf = PDFReport()
   pdf.add_page()
   pdf.chapter_title("Data Summary")
   pdf.chapter_content(report_content)
   pdf.output("Data_Analysis_Report.pdf")
   ```

   These methods ensure that the report has a professional structure with titles, content, and page numbers.

**Advantages of Automation**

Automating report generation provides several benefits:
- **Efficiency:** Saves time by reducing manual report creation.
- **Consistency:** Ensures a uniform format for all reports.
- **Scalability:** Handles large datasets and generates reports dynamically.

**Error Handling and Enhancements**

The script includes error handling to manage missing files gracefully. Future improvements could include:
- Dynamic user input for file names.
- Enhanced analysis, such as visualizations.
- Integration with additional file formats like Excel.

**Conclusion**

This automated process of reading data, analyzing it, and generating a PDF report demonstrates the power and versatility of Python for data-driven tasks. By combining `pandas` and `FPDF`, developers can create scalable and efficient solutions for data reporting in various domains.
